## Understanding the Basics: Sales Funnel vs. Landing Page

Before diving into the comparison, letâ€™s clarify the core differences between sales funnels and landing pages.

### What Is a Sales Funnel?

A **sales funnel** is a series of pages designed to guide visitors toward a specific marketing goalâ€”such as subscribing to an email list, signing up for a free trial, or making a purchase. Some examples of common sales funnels include:

- Lead nurturing funnels
- Lead conversion funnels
- Upselling funnels

Sales funnels simplify the customer journey, starting with awareness of your product or service and ending at the checkout page. Often, additional funnel steps upsell other products after the purchase is completed.

### What Is a Landing Page?

A **landing page**, on the other hand, is typically a standalone web page designed for a singular purpose, such as collecting leads, offering information about a product, or driving email subscriptions. Unlike sales funnels, landing pages donâ€™t guide users through a multi-step processâ€”they focus on one specific call-to-action (CTA).
