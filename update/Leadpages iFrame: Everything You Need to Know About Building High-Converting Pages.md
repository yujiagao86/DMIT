### Pop-Ups and LeadBoxes

A standout feature of Leadpages is **LeadBoxes**, which are customizable pop-ups that can be embedded anywhere on your website or blog. These can be triggered by user actions, such as clicking a button or after a timed delay, making it easy to capture leads effectively.

#### Exit Intent LeadBoxes
One of the most powerful features is the **Exit LeadBox**, designed to grab your visitor's attention as theyâ€™re about to leave your site. By offering valuable content or an irresistible call-to-action, you can convert more traffic into leads before they go.
